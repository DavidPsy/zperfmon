We keep only a day worth of failed uploads on the host.

The profile upload cron job runs 4 times every hour. Once each at 55th
and 25th minute, and once each at a 5 minute boundary between 55-25
and 25-55 minutes.

PROFILE_CLI_BY_DEFAULT
	- Ignored by non-CLI invocations. For CLI invocations, if set
	profile on/off check will be done at app init and app exit. If
	set to false, profiling on/off check will be done on calls to
	zperfmon_enable() and zperfmon_disable().

DISABLE_APC
	- Don't use APC even if loaded. Use case of CLI app profiling
	and multiple processes involved in profile collection.
