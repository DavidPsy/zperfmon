PHP profiling is completely based on xhprof extension by Facebook. Thank you
FB for the wonderfully practical xhprof.

There are a host of other technology pieces which went into the cauldron to
make this possible. jquery, YUI, google widgets, Datatables, MySQL nd more.
You could put in highcharts or D3 instead and get a much prettier interface.
